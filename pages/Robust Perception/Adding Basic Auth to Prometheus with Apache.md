# Adding Basic Auth to Prometheus with Apache


Having previously discussed why the [Prometheus project does not support SSL and user authentication out of the box](https://www.robustperception.io/prometheus-security-authentication-authorization-and-encryption/) and detailing [how to add basic authentication with Nginx](https://www.robustperception.io/adding-basic-auth-to-prometheus-with-nginx/), we will now demonstrate how to do the same with Apache.

Assuming you have Apache server installed on your machine, open up the `httpd.conf` configuration file located at `/etc/apache2/` and uncomment the following lines:

LoadModule proxy\_module libexec/apache2/mod\_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy\_http\_module libexec/apache2/mod\_proxy\_http.so

Next add the following to the bottom of `apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf` to proxy requests made to the server to our running Prometheus instance:

<VirtualHost \*:80>
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:9090/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:9090/
</VirtualHost>

You can test that this is working by restarting Apache with the command

$ sudo apachectl restart

and visiting [localhost](http://localhost/).

With the reverse proxy setup we can now add basic user authentication.

First we will create a password file containing a username and password that will grant access to our Prometheus server:

$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd admin
New password: 
Re-type new password: 
Adding password for user admin

Finally amend the previous section we added to require auth when accessing the Prometheus server:

<VirtualHost \*:80>
    ProxyPreserveHost on
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:9090/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:9090/
    <Location />
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Restricted Content"
        AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
        Require valid-user
    </Location>
</VirtualHost>

To see the changes we must again restart Apache:

$ sudo apachectl restart

Upon trying to access the Prometheus GUI, you should now be greeted with a prompt for a username and password.

Donâ€™t forget to lock down file permissions on the `.htpasswd file`, and keep it outside of any paths that are served over HTTP. The same approach can be used with other components of Prometheus, such as the Alertmanager and Node Exporter.
