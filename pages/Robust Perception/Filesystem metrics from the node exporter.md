# Filesystem metrics from the node exporter


The node exporter exposes filesystem metrics out of the box, so let's take a look.

The usual way to look at filesystem space usage is `df`:

$ df
Filesystem     1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
udev            16406128         0  16406128   0% /dev
tmpfs            3289028      3280   3285748   1% /run
/dev/md0        32881520  21934588   9253652  71% /
tmpfs           16445128    624400  15820728   4% /dev/shm
tmpfs               5120         4      5116   1% /run/lock
tmpfs           16445128         0  16445128   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs            3289024        28   3288996   1% /run/user/1000

The matching metrics from the node exporter for `1K-blocks` is `node_filesystem_size_bytes`. The node exporter uses base units, so `node_filesystem_size_bytes / 1024` should produce the same value (or going the other way, use `df -B1`). `Available` is `node_filesystem_avail_bytes`, which is how many bytes are free for use by normal users.

You might note that 32881520 - 21934588 - 9253652 = 1693280 so there's some missing space on the root filesystem. These are reserved blocks (`tune2fs /dev/md0` would show them for this ext4 filesystem) for the root user. `node_filesystem_free_bytes` represents the free space ignoring the reserved blocks. Thus `Used` would be `node_filesystem_size_bytes - node_filesystem_free_bytes`, however in practice you almost always want to use `node_filesystem_avail_bytes` rather than `node_filesystem_free_bytes`.Â  For for `Use%` you want `100 - (node_filesystem_avail_bytes/node_filesystem_size_bytes * 100)`. How best to alert on this has been [discussed previously](https://www.robustperception.io/reduce-noise-from-disk-space-alerts).

Space is only one resource to manage, Unix filesystems are also usually limited in terms of [inodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode) - basically the number of files there are. You can view these with `df -i`. Similarly the relevant metrics are `node_filesystem_files` for the total number of permitted inodes and `node_filesystem_files_free` for how many more you can have.

There's two other metrics. `node_filesystem_readonly` indicates if the filesystem is readonly, and `node_filesystem_device_error` indicates if there was a problem getting information for the filesystem via `statfs`. This is usually due to permissions issues.

If you look at the metrics themselves, you'll note there's `device`, `fstype`, and `mountpoint` labels:

This is as it is plausible that users will want to restrict alerts/graphs based on each of these aspects depending on the details of their deployment, so a separate \_info metric doesn't make sense in this particular case. This has the disadvantage that you must remember to aggregate away the labels you don't want.

Rather than limiting in PromQL, the node exporter can also ignore filesystems per the `--collector.filesystem.ignored-fs-types` and `--collector.filesystem.ignored-mount-points`flags. The defaults are intended to exclude various pseudo, readonly, and otherwise uninteresting filesystems. For example Docker can produce a lot of churn if there's a crashloop and the filesystems themselves should already already covered, so those paths are ignored out of the box. Occasional updates for new pseudo filesystems are required, note however that tmpfs is explicitly not ignored as you may care if something like `/var/run` filled up.
