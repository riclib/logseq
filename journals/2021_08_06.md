	  collapsed:: true
		- The {enc} is part of the conversion to xml
		- I optimised the function to not depend on the file anymore, so it was getting the raw string
		- I had only unit tested, the chain test with writeconfig from a savepipeline revealed the issue
		- Fixed by having the fragment generator `get_ws_sd` honor the end tag
		  ```java
		  		if( target.startsWith("{enc}")) { 
		  			target = target.replace("{enc}", "");
		  		}
		  ```
		- Released as [[SolidMon package]] v2.1.2

		- One field is always shownm regardless of repeat.
		- #bugfix #tsa_exporter
			- Added a new state with dark grey with no value
			- Added 1 to every query and updated the other colors to match
			- There was also a weird bug in grafana that I #techdebt fixed by making the queries range. The symptom was repeated fields.
- DONE Look at data for Crushftp -> not much
